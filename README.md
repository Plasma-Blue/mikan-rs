# mikan-rs

A *m*edical *i*mage *k*it for segment*a*tion metrics evaluatio*n*, native Rust support, and Python bindings for cross-language performance.

## 🎨Features

- 🚀**Blazing Fast Speed**: Written in Rust with high parallelization; speeds are 1-50 times faster than current tools, especially for Hausdorff distance calculations.
- 🧮**Comprehensive Metrics**: Easily compute a wide range of segmentation metrics:

  - **Confusion Matrix Based:**

    - Dice/IoU
    - TP/TN/FP/FN
    - Sensitivity/Specificity/Precision
    - Accuracy/Balanced Accuracy
    - ARI/FNR/FPR/F-score
    - Volume Similarity
    - MCC/nMCC/aMCC

  - **Distance Based:**
    - Hausdorff Distance
    - Hausdorff Distance 95
    - Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD)
    - Mean Average Surface Distance (MASD)

- 🐍**Python Interface**: Provides Python bindings for seamless integration and cross-language performance.

- 🎯**Simple Interface**: The API is so intuitive that you can use it right away without reading documentation! Whether using library functions, binary files, or Python functions, you have maximum flexibility in usage!

## 🍚Q&A

Q: Why are my results different from medpy/seg_metrics/miseval/Metrics Reloaded?
A: They are wrong. Of course, we might be wrong too. PRs to fix issues are welcome!
